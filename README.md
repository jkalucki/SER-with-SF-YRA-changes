# SER-with-SF-YRA-changes

The SF YRA publishes their Safety Equipment Requirements in a PDF
that isn't convienent for making checklists. I've copied the PDF
into spreadsheet format for 2024.

There's a Numbers version and an export from Numbers into xlsx Excel
format. I can't export into CSV as there are important strikethroughs.

**I assume no responsibility for transcription errors, interpretation
of YRA annotations, or out of date information. Double check my
work against the current YRA PDF. I cannot assume any liability for
errors or confusion.**

Safe racing!
